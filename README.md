Edureka Final Project Submission
Problem Statement:
AppleBite Co. is using Cloud for one of their products. The project uses modular components, multiple frameworks and want the components to be developed by different teams or by 3rd-party vendors. The company’s goal is to deliver the product updates frequently to production with High quality & Reliability. They also want to accelerate software delivery speed, quality and reduce feedback time between developers and testers.

Business challenge/requirement
As soon as the developer pushes the updated code on the GIT master branch, a new test server should be provisioned with all the required software. Post this, the code should be containerized and deployed on the test server. The deployment should then be tested using a test automation tool, and if the build is successful, it should be pushed to the prod server. All this should happen automatically and should be triggered from a push to the GitHub master branch.

Solution/Steps:
Git – For version control for tracking changes in the code files
Jenkins – For continuous integration and continuous deployment
Docker – For deploying containerized applications
Ansible - Configuration management tools
Selenium - For automating tests on the deployed web application 

This project will deploy code to dev/stage/prod etc, just on a click of button
